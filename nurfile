# Example, just for fun

# Just tell anybody or the "world" hello
def "nur hello" [
    name: string = "world"  # The name to say hello to
] {
    print $"hello ($name)"
}

# Actual useful tasks - doing the same as the justfile does

# Run cargo
def "nur cargo" [...args: string] {
    cargo ...$args
}

# Run cargo build
def "nur build" [...args: string] {
    cargo "build" ...$args
}

# Run cargo run
def "nur run" [...args: string] {
    cargo "run" ...$args
}

# Build a cargo release
def "nur release" [] {
    cargo build --release
}

# Publish to crates.io
def "nur publish" [] {
    cargo publish
}
